        <h1>Hello World, This is Dan Gauthier</h1>
        
        <p>Hello,

I am Dan Gauthier and I am the instructor for CSC 436 and CSC 106.

Some background about me. I recently graduated (August 2020) from the University of Rhode Island with my Master's in Computer Science with research in computer science education. I also am very interested in the cybersecurity field, getting a Graduate Certificate from the DFCSC center at URI. I graduated the year before with my undergrad in Computer Science. I grew up in Narragansett, RI, and have recently moved to the NYC metro area to start my career in software engineering. While the pandemic has definitely changed things, as timing graduation with one is not recommended... I have enjoyed getting to spend time cooking, walking around outside, and learn more about what I want.  I look forward to reading your posts and have a great start to your Spring semester. Please do not hesitate to send an email if you have any questions throughout the semester on course material as well as URI in general!

            -Dan Gauthier </p>
